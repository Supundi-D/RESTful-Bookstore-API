# RESTful-Bookstore-API
The API is built using JAX-RS for RESTful web services, and communicates using JSON as the data format. Postman was used as the primary tool for executing the test cases and capturing results. The test cases are presented in a tabular format, categorized by their resource classes, to provide clear insights into the behavior of each endpoint.
